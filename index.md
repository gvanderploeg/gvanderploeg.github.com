### Welcome to gvanderploeg.github.com
This page serves as the starting point for all of my Github projects. Some can be showcased here, others require a local setup.

### [t.nos.nl](//gvanderploeg.github.io/t.nos.nl/)

A completely client side application that renders NOS's RSS feed with the same look and feel as the old 't.nos.nl', the text only NOS site. That site has been discontinued in favor of the archaic teletekst app.
As I'm very fond of text only news reading (and because I'm allergic to the fonts and colors of teletekst) I recreated the site making use of the already available RSS feed.
And I wonder why NOS did not choose that path originally when creating/maintaining t.nos.nl...
